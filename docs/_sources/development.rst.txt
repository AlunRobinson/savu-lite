Development notes for savu-lite

Cooking with Conda
==================

To set-up the basic development environment downloaded Miniconda2-latest-linux-x86_64.sh and installed on local machine.  Update to get latest versions and then install conda-build,  conda-verify, sphinx (for documentation), and anaconda-client (to allow uploading to anaconda cloud).

1) conda update conda
2) conda install conda-build
3) conda install conda-verify
4) conda install sphinx
5) conda install anaconda-client

Savu Training Example
=====================

Training examples are documented here: `trainingexamples`_

savu data/24737.nxs process_lists/simple_tomo_pipeline_cpu.nxs .

Use of PIP with conda
=====================

Currently the following files need to be pip installed as part of the build.sh script:

* gnureadline
* nvidia-ml-py

However Conda and Pip donâ€™t play well together and this is only an interim solution.
